## To enable pipelines

- Manually created app registration in Entra/AAD
- created admin group in Entra/AAD added myself, the app registration/service principal and managed identity. used in iac for sql server
- created resource group, iac pipeline needs RG to be created beforehand
- manually needs to set firebase secrets in kv
- in devops create service connection witch points to app registration. use this in ci/cd pipeline in azureSubscription property
- manually added admin group as contributer to web app. otherwise pipelin cant deploy code (not needed?)
- manually added admin group as contributer to subscription. otherwise pipeline cant deploy code

- if deploy pipeline gives sql connection error. run again. sql is free tier so might need to warm up
  har sat retry p√•
